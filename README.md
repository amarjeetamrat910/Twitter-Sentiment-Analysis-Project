Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

Description: Conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset of vaccination-related tweets to gain insights into public opinion. Preprocessed text data by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and stopwords. Applied stemming to reduce words to their base form. Used TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity of each tweet. Categorized sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral based on polarity scores. Visualized most frequent words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets using word clouds. Employed CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical format. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data. Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix. Visualized the results using heatmaps. Achieved an accuracy score of XX%. Conducted cross-validation with a Support Vector Machine classifier, achieving a maximum accuracy of XX%.
